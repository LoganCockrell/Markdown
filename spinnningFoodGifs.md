# Spinning food gifs

[Go home button](README.md)

I am not sure why but I am very fascinated by high quality gifs of food just spinning in circles. Like, how is it so high quality? Who made this and why?

I know that some of these gifs are not actually food but they are still unreasonably high quality.
